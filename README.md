# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling null values and provides a solution.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function `foo` that attempts to add two numbers.  However, it does not correctly handle cases where one or both inputs might be null.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows a corrected version of `foo` that explicitly checks for null values before performing the addition. This prevents errors and unexpected results.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred JavaScript environment.
3. Run each file to observe the difference in behavior.
